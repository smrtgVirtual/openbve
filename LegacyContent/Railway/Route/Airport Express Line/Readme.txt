Thank you for downloading the Airport Express Line by Nickgoh45. This route is for openBVE only. As of now, a West-Bound route for this line is being constructed. The default train is C151. (http://www.wcvp.bvesg.co.cc)

I would like to thank Michelle for her animated escalators, YellowFlip999 for helping me with the installation with all PSDs(Platform Screen Doors) and his kind permission to allow me to use the routes. Other that, there are quite a number of objects created by me, especially the station roofs.

If I have left out anyone I should thank, do feel free to let me know. I'll be willing to add in your contribution in the readme in the next release.

Do not use any objects in my routes without permission! If you want to use or modify them, please at least ask me for permission.

As always, remember to check http://www.hbvcity.bvesg.co.cc for regular updates of the routes. Do also try out the Harbourvale Line and other routes on my website! Happy driving!

Thank you,
Nickgoh45
